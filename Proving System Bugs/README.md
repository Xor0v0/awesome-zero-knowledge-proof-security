# Proving Systme Bugs

Proving system is a cryptographic tool to prove the correct execution of the circuits. The choice of proving system and framework is dependent on the requirements of the project and does affect the front end used. 

Unlike circuit bugs, proving system bugs are some more fundamental vulnerabilities that are strongly related to cryptography or even mathematics. Including but not limited to:

- [Bad Polynomial Implementation](./Bad%20Polynomial%20Impl.md)
- [Frozen Heart](./Frozen%20Heart.md)
- [Lack of Domain Seperation](./Lack%20of%20Domain%20Seperation.md)
- [Missing Curve Point Check](./Missing%20Curve%20Point%20Check.md)
- [Unsecure Hash Function](./Unsecure%20Hash%20Function.md)
